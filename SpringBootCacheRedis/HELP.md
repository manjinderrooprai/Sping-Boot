# Spring Boot Cache with redis
This project serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for integrating caching in a Spring Boot application using Redis as the caching provider.

### Overview
Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in memory, thereby improving the performance and scalability of applications. In this PoC, we demonstrate how to configure and utilize caching in a Spring Boot application leveraging Redis, an in-memory data store.

### OpenAPI
OpenAPI is a specification for building and documenting RESTful APIs. It defines a standardized format (JSON or YAML) to describe an API's structure, endpoints, and functionality, promoting easy understanding, machine-readability, and interoperability. This allows for efficient development, documentation, and interaction with APIs.
