# Spring Boot Data Jpa
This project demonstrates a simple Spring Boot application configured with Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database.

### MySQL
MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system. It is known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. In this project, MySQL serves as the database backend for storing and managing application data.

### OpenAPI
OpenAPI is a specification for building and documenting RESTful APIs. It defines a standardized format (JSON or YAML) to describe an API's structure, endpoints, and functionality, promoting easy understanding, machine-readability, and interoperability. This allows for efficient development, documentation, and interaction with APIs.
