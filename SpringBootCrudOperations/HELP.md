# Spring Boot CRUD operations with H2 Database 
Carrying out CRUD operations with H2 within Spring Boot is the same as with other SQL databases.

### H2 Database
H2 Database is a lightweight, open-source relational database management system written in Java. It supports embedded and server modes, in-memory databases, SQL compatibility, transactions, and features a web-based console. It is known for its simplicity, speed, and versatility in various applications, offering both embedded and client-server deployment options.

### OpenAPI
OpenAPI is a specification for building and documenting RESTful APIs. It defines a standardized format (JSON or YAML) to describe an API's structure, endpoints, and functionality, promoting easy understanding, machine-readability, and interoperability. This allows for efficient development, documentation, and interaction with APIs.
